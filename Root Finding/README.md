This code finds the root of a given polynomial with three different methods:

1. Bisection method

2. Secant method

3. Hybrid method



Function takes n+4 command line arguments for solving nth order polynomial,

first n+1 input are the coefficients of the polynomial starting from the highest ordered term.

The last 3 arguments are the two initial guesses and tolerance value
